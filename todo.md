# Website Fixes

## August 8

- [x] Remove the tagline attached to the logo on the footer – let’s have just the logo here

- [] When you hover over a tab at the top of the website, the word disappears – any way to make that blue so the word is still visible?

- [] On our homepage under EXPLORE OUR PROGRAMS – I think we need to have the 3 programs listed. Want potential students to know what we offer right on the home page vs just showing “healthcare”. Can you add all 3 programs here with the appropriate images as per below? These should line up perfectly with the 3 blocks above – “HOW TO APPLY”, “WHY ELEVARE” and “CAREER SERVICES”
