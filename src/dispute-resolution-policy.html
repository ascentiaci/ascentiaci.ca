      <li>This policy governs complaints from students respecting&nbsp;Ascentia Career Institute and any aspect of its operations.</li>
      
      
      
      <li>A student who makes or is otherwise involved in a complaint will not be subject to any form of retaliation by the institution at any time.</li>
      
      
      
      <li>The process by which the student complain will be handled is as follows:
      <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
      <li>Student complaints must be made in writing.</li>
      
      
      
      <li>Upon submission of the complaint to the Executive Director, Alda Messiah, who can be reached at alda@ascentiaci.ca</li>
      
      
      
      <li>The Executive Director will then reach out to the effected parties to determine an equitable resolution to the complaint.</li>
      
      
      
      <li>If the Executive Director is unavailable or is the subject of the complain, the alternate individual can be reached at &lt;INSERT DETAILS OF ALTERNATE&gt;</li>
      
      
      
      <li>The institution will provide the reasons for the determination and any reconsideration (if applicable) to the student within 30 days after the date on which the student made the complaint.</li>
      
      
      
      <li>The written reasons will advise a student, that if the student is dissatisfied with the determination, and has been misled by the institution regarding any significant aspect of that program, the student may file a complaint with the Private Training Institutions Branch (PTIB) (www.privatetraininginstitutions.gov.bc.ca). Complaints must be filed with PTIB within one year of the date a student completes, is dismissed from, or withdraws from the program.</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      
      
      
      <li>The student making the complaint may be represented by an agent or a lawyer.</li>
