              This policy governs complaints from students respecting
              $BRAND_SC™️ Career Institute and any aspect of its operations.
            </li>
            <li>
              A student who makes or is otherwise involved in a complaint will
              not be subject to any form of retaliation by the institution at
              any time.
            </li>
            <li>
              The process by which the student complaint will be handled is as
              follows:
              <ol class="list-lower-roman">
                <li>Student complaints must be made in writing.</li>
                <li>
                  Upon submission of the complaint to the Executive Director,
                  Alda Messiah, who can be reached at
                  <a href="mailto:alda@$BRAND_SCci.ca">alda@$BRAND_SCci.ca</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Executive Director will then reach out to the affected
                  parties to determine an equitable resolution to the complaint.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the Executive Director is unavailable or is the subject of
                  the complaint, the alternate individual can be reached at
                  &lt;INSERT DETAILS OF ALTERNATE&gt;
                </li>
                <li>
                  The institution will provide the reasons for the determination
                  and any reconsideration (if applicable) to the student within
                  30 days after the date on which the student made the
                  complaint.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The written reasons will advise a student, that if the student
                  is dissatisfied with the determination, and has been misled by
                  the institution regarding any significant aspect of that
                  program, the student may file a complaint with the Private
                  Training Institutions Branch (PTIB) (<a
                    rel="noopener"
                    href="https://www.privatetraininginstitutions.gov.bc.ca"
                    target="_blank"
                    >www.privatetraininginstitutions.gov.bc.ca</a
                  >). Complaints must be filed with PTIB within one year of the
                  date a student completes, is dismissed from, or withdraws from
                  the program.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              The student making the complaint may be represented by an agent or
              a lawyer.
