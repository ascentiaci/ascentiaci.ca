            <strong>$BUILD_BRAND_SC Career Institute</strong> is certified with
            the Private Training Institutions Branch (PTIB) of the British
            Columbia Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Training.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before you enrol at a certified private training institution, you
            should be aware of your rights and responsibilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            You have the right to be treated fairly and respectfully by the
            institution.
          </p>

          <p>
            You have the right to a student enrolment contract that includes the
            following information:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Amount of tuition and any additional fees for your program</li>
            <li>Refund policy</li>
            <li>
              If your program includes a work experience, the requirements to
              participate in the work experience and the geographic area where
              it will be provided
            </li>
            <li>
              Whether the program was approved by PTIB or does not require
              approval
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Make sure you read the contract before signing. The institution must
            provide you with a signed copy.
          </p>

          <p>
            You have the right to access the institutionâ€™s dispute resolution
            process and to be protected against retaliation for making a
            complaint.
          </p>

          <p>
            You have the right to make a claim to PTIB for a tuition refund if:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your institution ceased to hold a certificate before you completed
              an approved program
            </li>
            <li>
              You were misled about a significant aspect of your approved
              program
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You must file the claim within one year of completing, being
            dismissed, or withdrawing from your program.
          </p>
