          <p>
            $BUILD_BRAND_SC Career Institute wishes to confirm its
            responsibility to provide a safe and secure learning environment. At
            $BUILD_BRAND_SC Career Institute, we firmly believe that there
            should be a safe environment for all the students, which is free
            from any kind of sexual misconduct as the college has zero tolerance
            towards this kind of misconduct.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through this policy the institutions strive to prevent sexual
            misconduct and create a procedure to respond effectively and in a
            timely manner when incidents occur.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2016 the Government of BC introduced the Sexual Violence and
            Misconduct Policy Act S.B.C. c.23 (the Act). The Act requires BC
            post secondary institutions to establish, implement, and make
            publicly available a policy, with associated procedures, that
            addresses sexual misconduct, its prevention, and responses to sexual
            misconduct. This Policy has been designed in compliance with the
            Act.

        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            The policy applies to students, faculty and staff members working at
            $BUILD_BRAND_SC Career Institute as well as extends to the visitors,
            volunteers and contractors at the campus, who may be found involved
            in any act of violating the respectful environment of the college by
            indulging in any sexual violence or misconduct.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sexual misconduct is defined as any form of undesired activity of a
            sexual nature which intends to violate the sexual integrity of the
            individual to whom it is directed. Sexual assault is characterized
            by a broad range of behaviors that involve the use of coercion,
            threats or control towards a person which makes the person feel
            uncomfortable, distressed, frightened.
          </p>
          <p>Sexual misconduct may involve:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sexual Assault</li>
            <li>Sexual Exploitation</li>

          <h3>Reporting/Disclosure Procedure</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            The person who wishes to disclose sexual misconduct or make a formal
            report against it may do so as per the following process:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Victim/Survivor safety comes first. Campus staff will discreetly
              ensure that the victim/survivor will receive any required medical
              attention and any security measures required to keep them safe.
            </li>
            <li>
              The person (victim) may choose to disclose the sexual misconduct
              to the Executive Director/SEA of $BUILD_BRAND_SC Career Institute,
              without making a formal report. In this case a formal process may
              not be initiated, but the management will deal with the disclosure
              seriously and may take steps to avoid the repetition of the
              incident.
            </li>
            <li>
              To initiate a formal process, the victim or a member of the
              college community, on behalf of the victim, needs to submit a
              report in writing to the Executive Director/ Senior Educational
              Administrator of $BUILD_BRAND_SC Career Institute.
            </li>
            <li>
              The person against whom allegations are made will be informed
              about the same, keeping the name and details of the complainant
              private. The person will be given 24 hours’ time to submit written
              explanation about the incident. The SEA of $BUILD_BRAND_SC Career
              Institute will then verify all the available evidence and if found
              guilty, the alleged perpetrator will be asked to offer a written
              apology to the complainant and will also be expelled from
              work/study (as the case may be).
            </li>
            <li>
              If the perpetrator is a visitor, whom the $BUILD_BRAND_SC Career
              Institute authorities cannot access, the information of the
              visitor will be given to the local police along with the copy of
              the complaint, if the complainant agrees to this.
            </li>
            <li>
              The information of the complainant will be kept confidential
              according to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy
              Act, unless, it becomes mandatory by law to disclose the
              information to get full justice to the complainant. If required,
              the complainant will be given to counseling or emergency medical
              care to overcome the mental or physical problems faced by the
              complainant due to the incident.
